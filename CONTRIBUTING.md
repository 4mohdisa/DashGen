# Contributing to DashGen

We love your input! We want to make contributing to DashGen as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (ESLint + Prettier)
- Use conventional commits for commit messages
- Write clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

## Commit Message Format

We use conventional commits. Examples:

```
feat: add data export functionality
fix: resolve chart rendering issue
docs: update installation instructions
style: format code with prettier
refactor: simplify data parsing logic
test: add unit tests for dashboard generation
```

## Development Setup

1. Clone your fork of the repo
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (see README.md)
4. Start development server: `npm run dev`
5. Run tests: `npm test`
6. Run linting: `npm run lint`

## Feature Requests

We use GitHub issues to track feature requests. Please provide:

- Clear description of the feature
- Use case and motivation
- Examples of how it would work
- Any relevant mockups or designs

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## License
